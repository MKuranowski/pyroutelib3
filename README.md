# pyroutelib3

A continuation of [pyroutelib2](https://github.com/gaulinmp/pyroutelib2).
Routing on OSM data in Python 3.

OSM Data tiles is stored in `tilescache/`

## ⚠️ Version warning

A planned major 2.0.0 release will come with breaking API changes; as per semantic versioning.
Make sure your requirement files specify `pyroutelib3 <2.0.0` to prevent your code from breaking.

## Usage

```python
from pyroutelib3 import Router # Import the router
router = Router("<transport mode>") # Initialise it

start = router.findNode(lat, lon) # Find start and end nodes
end = router.findNode(lat, lon)

status, route = router.doRoute(start, end) # Find the route - a list of OSM nodes

if status == 'success':
    routeLatLons = list(map(router.nodeLatLon, route)) # Get actual route coordinates

```
**Transport Modes**: car, cycle, foot, horse, tram, train

**Statuses**: success, no_route, gave_up


##### Offline Routing

If you want to use pyroutelib3 offline or on custom .osm file, you just need to add a second argument to Router:
Path to the specific osm file.

```python
from pyroutelib3 import Router
router = Router("<transport mode>", "<path-to-.osm-file>")
# Continue on doing like in the example above
```


Starting from 1.5 pyroutelib3 now accepts other file formats then OSM XML: .osm.gz, .osm.bz2 and .osm.pbf.
However, one has to inform pyroutelib3 what kind of file was provided, like so:

```python
from pyroutelib3 import Router
router = Router("<transport mode>", "<path-to-file>", localfileType="<xml/gz/bz2/pbf>")
```

## Changes from pyroutelib2
- Porting to python3
- Making pyroutelib a package
- Custom transport types
- Handling the access keys
- Turn restrictions
- Offline routers (load only local osm file)
